Indexing Consistency, Quality and Efficiency
.A
Rolling, L.
.W
    Indexing quality determines whether the information content of an indexed
document is accurately represented.  Indexing effectiveness measures whether
an indexed document is correctly retrieved every time it is relevant to a
query.  Measurement of these criteria is cumbersome and costly; data base
producers therefore prefer inter-indexer consistency as a measure of indexing
quality or effectiveness.  The present article assesses the validity of this
substitution in various environments.

Lexical Problems in Large Distributed Information Systems
.A
Berkovich, S.Y.
Shneiderman, B.
.W
    The lexical problems in large information systems are created by the
necessity of handling a great number of names and their interrelations.
Such lexical problems are not covered completely by the concept data
dictionaries, which are mostly concerned with database scheme design rather
than the execution of operations.  In this paper we introduce our view of a
lexical subsystem as a separate component in an information system architecture,
to deal with linguistic and control functions concerning the lexical problems
in local and network environments.  The lexical suybsystem is a special
efficiently organized program package, which plays the role of a "linguistic
filter" in a broad sense for lexically incorrect queries, promotes integration
of databases and information retrieval systems, and facilitates the creation
of local information systems.  We hope that lexical subsystems can become
productive for any large, especially distributed, information system.

Experiments in Local Metrical Feedback in Full-Text Retrieval Systems
.A
Attar, R.
Fraenkel, A.S.
.W
    A method of iterative searching, using the results of one iteration search
to formulate the next iteration search, was applied to a full-text database
consisting of some 2400 documents and 1,3000,000 text-words of Hebrew and
Aramaic.  The iterative method consists of clustering the documents returned
in an iteration, using weighting by proximity and by frequency simultaneously.
The process produces searchonyms, which are terms synonymous to keywords in the
context of a single query.  Augumenting or replacing keywords by searchonyms
via manual or automatic feedback leads to the formulation of the next iteration
search.  The results of the experiment are consistent with those of an earlier
small-scale experiment on an English database, and indicate that in contrast
to global clustering where the size of matrices limits applications to small
databases and improvements are doubtful, local metrical methods appear to be
well suited to arbitrarily large databases, improving precision and recall
simultaneously.  Further experiments using more test-queries run on even
larger databases should be made to collect further evidence as to the
performance of these methods.

Cocited Author Retrieval Online:
An Experiment with the Social Indicators Literature
.A
White, H.D.
.W
    One mode of online retrieval in Scisearch or Social Scisearch involves
entering pairs of authors' names believed to be jointly cited by
subsequent writers and retrieving papers in which cocitations occur.  Six
pairs were formed with the names of four authors prominent in the social
indicators movement (Bauer, Duncan, Land, and Sheldon).  Documents by the
four were not specified.  It was thought that the pair Duncan and Land
would retrieve papers in which indicator-type data would be integrated with
path-analytic causal modeling.  All other pairs seemed likely to retrieve a
"general social indicators" literature.  The 298 retrieved papers confirmed
expectattions.  It was found that 121 papers generally cited social indicators
(SI) documents by the input authors and frequently had SI language in
their titles.  Other signs of content also identified them as papers of
the SI movement.  The 177 papers retrieved on Duncan and Land generally
cited causal modeling documents by the input pair and were path-analytic
in nature.  As expected, they were relatively "harder" than the first
group of papers, although the two groups are akin and are formally linked
through citations in certain papers.  An additional result is that papers
citing at least three of the input authors tend to be overviews of the SI
movement.

Answer-Passage Retrieval by Text Searching
.A
O'Connor, J.
.W
    Passage retrieval (already operational for lawyers) has advantages in
output form opver references retrieval and is economically feasible.
Previous experiments in passage retrieval for scientists have demonstrated
recall and false retrieval rates as good or better than those of present
reference retrieval services.  The present experiment involved a greater
variety of forms of retrieval question.  In addition, search words were
selected independently by two different people for each retrieval question.
The search words selected, in combination with the computer procedures used
for passage retrieval, produced average recall ratios of 72 and 67%,
respectively, for the two selectors.  The false retrieval rates were (except
for one predictably difficult question) respectively 13 and 10 falsely
retrieved sentences per answer-paper retrieved.

Searching Biases in Large Interactive Document Retrieval Systems
.A
Blair, D.C.
.W
    The way that individuals construct and modify search queries on a
large interactive document retrieval system is subject to systematic biases
similar to those that have been demonstrated in experiments on judgements
under uncertainty.  These biases are shared by both naive and sophisticated
subjects and cause the inquirer searching for documents on a large interactive
system to construct and modify queries inefficiently.  A searching algorithm
is suggested that helps the inquirer to avoid the effect of these biases.

Directions in Library Networking
.A
Avram, H.D.
McCallum, S.H.
.W
    Bibliographic control before and after MARC is reviewed.  The capability
of keying into online systems brought an interdependence among libraries,
the service centers that mediate between them, and the large utilities that
process and distribute data.  From this has developed the basic network
structure among libraries in the United States.  The independent development
of major networks has brought problems in standardization and coordination.
The authors point out that while technology has led toward centralization
of automated library services, new developments are now pushing toward
decentralization.  Coordination is a requirement to avoid fragmentation in
this new environment.

    REFLES is a microcomputer-based system for data retrieval in library
environments.  The problem of information retrieval is discussed from a
theoretical point of view, followed by an analysis of the reference process
and data thereby gathered, leading to a description of REFLES in terms of
its hardware and software.  REFLES, a prototype system at present, currently
functions in a test environment.  Examples of data contained in the system
and of its use are presented.  Future considerations and speculations on
other versions of the system conclude the paper.

Performance Testing of a Book and Its Index as a Information Retrieval
System
.A
Bennion, B.C.
.W
    The retrieval performance of book indexes can be measured in terms of
their ability to direct a user selectively to text material whose identity
but not location is known.  The method requires human searchers to base
their searching strategies on actual passages from the book rather than on
test queries, natural or contrived.  It circumvents the need for relevance
judgement, but still yields performance indicators that correspond
approximately to the recall and precision ratios of large document retrieval
system evaluation.  A preliminary application of the method to the subject
indexing of two major encyclopedias showed one encyclopedia apparently
superior in both the finding and discrimination abilities of retrieval
performance.  The method is presently best suited for comparative testing
since its ability to yield absolute or reproducible measures is as yet not
established.

Normalization of Titles and Their Retrieval
.A
Takamatsu, S.
Fujita, UY.
Nishida, F.
.W
    This paper presents a method of normalizations of English titles and
their retrieval.  The title expressed by a noun phrase or a noun clause
is converted to a function-expression by parsing.  For the retrieval with
a reasonable recall rate as well as a high precision rate, the function-
expression is transformed to a predicate-governor form, and then normalized
to a standard form.  Therefrom, various items are extracted and recorded
in a hierarchical tree-like inverted file.

    In order to keep the recall rate in a reasonable value, several
retrieval stages are implemented based on the key-term and case-label
matching.  The retrieval is controlled by the preciseness of the specification
of case-labels for each key-term.

An Automatic Method for Extracting Significant
Phrases in Scienfific or Technical Documents
.A
Maeda, T.
Momouchi, J.
Sawamura, H.
.W
    A new method is described to extract significant phrases in the title
and the abstreact of scientific or technical documents.  The method is
based upon a text structure analysis and uses a relatively small dictionary.
The dictionary has been constructed based on the knowledge about concepts
in the field of science or technology and some lexical knowledge.  For
significant phrases and their component items may be used in different
meanings among the fields.  A text analysius approach has been applied to
select significant phrases as substantial and semantic information carriers
of the contents of the abstract.

    The results of the experiment for five sets of documents have shown
that the significant phrases are effectively extracted in all cases, and
the number of them for every document and the processing time is fairly
satisfactory.  The information representation of the document, partly
using the method, is discussed with relation to the construction of the
document information retrieval system.

Parallel Computations in Information Retrieval

Salton, G.
Bergmark, D.
.W
    Conventional information retrieval processes are largely based on data
movement, pointer manipulations and integer arithmetic; more refined retrieval
algorithms may in addition benefit from substantial computational power.

    In the present study a number of parallel processing methods are described
that serve to enhance retrieval services.  In conventional retrieval
environments parallel list processing and parallel search facilities are of
greatest interest.  In more advanced systems, the use of array processors
also proves beneficial.  Various information retrieval processes are examined
and evidence is given to demonstrate the usefulness of parallel processing
and fast computational facilities in information retrieval.

Co-Citation Context Analysis and the Structure of Paradigms
.A
Small, H.
.W
    Many information scientists are concerned with the operation of
document retrieval systems serving scientists in various fields.  The
scientists served by these systems are often members of what have been called
invisible colleges, groups of scientists in frequent communication with
one another and involved with highly specialized subject matters.  Often
such groups are considered to share an intellectual perspective regarding
this subject matter, which is sometimes referred to as a paradigm.

    The purpose of this paper is to show how it is possible to identify
paradigms, using the techniques of citation analysis.  I will operationalize
the notion of paradigm as a 'consensual structure of concepts in a field.'
Suppose we have obtained a set of papers pertaining to some topic.  Already
knowing something about the field, we read each text and mark passages in
which certain specific concepts are used or discussed.  For example, we
might find that a concept designated 'A' appears in some sub-set of the
papers.  Suppose further that we identify those papers in which concepts 'A'
and 'B' are used together in the same papers in a certain specified manner.
Clearly not all concepts will combine in a natural way, and not all authors
combining concepts 'A' and 'B' will do so in the same way, though some
predominant mode may emerge.  For a set of n concepts their structure is
given by the totality of admissible combinations of concepts taken from
two to n at a time.  The frequency with which a given combination occurs
in the sample of papers on the topic is a measure of the degree of consensus
regarding the particular concept combination within the corpus.  For
concepts taken two at a time, the structure can be displayed as a graph with
concepts as nodes and the relations between them represented as lines (arcs)
connecting the nodes.  This definition of concept structure is
similar to the semantic network of artificial intelligence except that in
our approach a measure of consensus weights each arc of the graph.

    A prototype system is created that integrates a microfiche catalog
into an online computer system for bibliographic control.  Costs and
operational data are collected and analyzed.  The system permits the more
economical microfiche storage of catalog records than would be feasible
for comparable online magnetic disk storage.  Experimental tests
demonstrate the feasibility of the online microfiche catalog system for use
in library technical services and retrieval of bibliographic data.  The
primary result of the project is the creation of a completely operational
facility, including all equipment, software, procedures, and data bases
necessary to demonstrate the system.  A second set of results is derived
from the experimental use of the system and the evaluation of costs and
times for various operations.  The cost effectiveness of the online microfiche
catalog is demonstrated.

A General Formulation of Bradford's Distribution:  The Graph-Oriented
Approach
.A
Asai, I.
.W
    From the detailed analysis of eight previously published mathematical
models, a general formulation of Bradford's distribution can be deduced as
follows:  y = a log(x + c) + b, where y is the ratio of the cumulative
frequency of articles to the total number of articles and x is the ratio
of the rank of journals to the total number of journals.  The parameters a, b,
and c are the slope, the intercept, and the shift in a straight line to log rank,
respectively.  Each of the eight models is a special case of the general
formulation and is one of five types of formulation.  In order to estimate
three unknown parameters, a statistical method using root-weighted square
error is proposed.  A comparative experiment using 11 databases suggests that
the fifth type of formulation with three unknown parameters is the best fit
to the observed data.  A further experiment shows that the deletion of the
droop data leads to a more accurate value of parameters and less error.
